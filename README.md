# Automate_Spotify_Playlists
Uses Spotify's API to parse through 2 different playlists and determine which songs are in both playlists.

## Why do I need this?
I have a lot of playlists on Spotify and mutliple playlists for each genre. Sometimes I forget if I've already added a song to a different playlist. Using the Automate Spotify Playlists, I'm able to compare two playlists with each other. Returns the artist name and the song name for each song that appears in both playlists.
