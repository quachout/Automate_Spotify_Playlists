# Automate_Spotify_Playlists
Uses Spotify's API to parse through 2 different playlists and determine which songs are in both playlists.

## Why do I need this?
Ever have multiple playlists and wonder if you've already added a song to that playlist? My solution is to us the Automate Spotify Playlists that compares two playlists with each other. It returns the artist name and the song name for each song that appears in both playlists. From there, you will know whether or not you have already added that song to the playlists.
